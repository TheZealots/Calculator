#Final GUI of the Calc

For this branch about Graphical user interface (GUI), GUI a computer program that enables a person to communicate with a computer through the use of symbols, visual metaphors, and pointing devices. It consists of picture-like items The main pieces of a GUI are a pointer, icons, windows, menus, scroll bars, and an intuitive input device. You can see the interface of a calculator in our code. We used Tkinter. Tkinter is the most commonly used method. It is a standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit shipped with Python. Python with Tkinter outputs the fastest and easiest way to create GUI applications.

#Logic

For this simple calculator, two numbers were taken and a defining function branching is used to execute a particular section.
Every defining function has it's own function inside the function body, the return statement determines the value to be returned.
There are functions for add, symbol, clear, clear entry means button that clear the most recent entry, 'ans' means the variable that holds the last answer stored in the
calculator and a function that can equal the number and also update the equation. In our code there are 'comment's' that explain every defining functions.

#Final Code


Inside this branch is the final output of our Simple Calculator combining the GUI code using Tkinter
and the logic we made about the calculator. We finally ran the code and found no error in it, seeing the GUI in the python and
using the calculator with no problem. All buttons are working and is ready to submit.
