#Code Logic

For this simple calculator, two numbers were taken and a defining function branching is used to execute a particular section.
Every defining function has it's own function inside the function body, the return statement determines the value to be returned.
There are functions for add, symbol, clear, clear entry means button that clear the most recent entry, 'ans' means the variable that holds the last answer stored in the
calculator and a function that can equal the number and also update the equation. In our code there are 'comment's' that explain every defining functions.
